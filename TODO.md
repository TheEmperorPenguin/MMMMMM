- [ ] look if src / srcs / source / sources exit and include / includes for moveScript cause else kind of ugly what happens
- ( ) add a revert to the file moved

- [ ] add to path to specific file and not only ./zshrc
- [ ] add verbose/human mode
- [ ] make libraries (with a rule to execute with main.c / test.c (whatever) to compile like a program to test the library)
- [ ] handle libraries in project(test with libft)
- [ ] Make most of the functionality available at creation later available to modify already existing makefile
- [ ] Choose better name for flags, and double them, -n == --name 
- [ ] update Readme
